## Overview

This repository explores public sentiment regarding electric vehicles (EVs) on Twitter using advanced NLP tools. The study focuses on how sentiment shifted between January 2020 and December 2023, influenced by significant policies like the Biden administrationâ€™s "Build Back Better" agenda.

In this project, we used transformer-based models (BERT and RoBERTa) and VADER to classify tweets into positive, neutral, and negative sentiments. The analysis examines the relationship between public sentiment, government policies, and the broader adoption of sustainable transportation.
